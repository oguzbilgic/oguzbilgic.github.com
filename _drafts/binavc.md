# Bitcoin is not a Virtual Currency

_October 2013_

Bitcoin is not a virtual currency, calling it so would mislead us about the changes it will cause. Bitcoin is a **decentralized** and **virtual** proof of ownership. Currently the asset it virtualizesis the bitcoin currency (XBT). Let me clarify this sentence by giving few definitions.

## Virtual

Virtual means that the proof of ownership of the underlying asset can be transfered using the internet, without dealing with physical items. 

## Decentralized vs Centralized

If there has to be a third party other than the sender and the receiver to tansfer the ownership, It is called centralized. However If It can be transfered without the help of the third party, It is decentralized.

## Layers of Virtualization of our Financial System

Next, let me very shortly explain how currently our financial system deals with the buying power a.k.a money which is an asset.

## Buying Power - Money

Money is a measurement of buying power.

## Currency

Currency is a scale of buying power issued by governments. Currency can be maniplated by it's creater via adjusting interest rates, increasing the circulattion volume, etc.

## Cash

Cash is a physical representation of it's currency. It is used for transfering the underlying currency. Cash is decentralized, however it is not virtual meaning that the cash physically has to chanage places so that It can be used by someone else.

## Banks

Bank is a virtualization layer for cash. They are basically WaaS, *Wallet as a Service*. They help us by translating the cash into bits and bytes to make the currency virtual. Using the banks currency can be transferred between two parties using the internet. However this comes with a cost which is that It is not decentralized meaning that without the banks we can't send or receive the money online.
