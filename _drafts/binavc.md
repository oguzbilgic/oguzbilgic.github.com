# Bitcoin is not a Virtual Currency

_October 2013_

Bitcoin is not a virtual currency, calling it so would be an
huge underestimation of the power of it and would mislead us
about the changes it will cause. Bitcoin is a decentralized 
and virtual proof of ownership. Currently the asset it virtualizes
is the bitcoin currency (XBT). Let me clarify this sentence by 
giving few definitions.

## Virtual

Virtual means that the proof of ownership of the underlying asset
can be transferable using internet, without dealing with physical
items. 

## Decentralized vs Centralized

If there as to be a third party other than the sender and the 
receiver, It is called centralized. However if you can transfer 
the ownership without the help of the third party, It is 
decentralized.

## Layers of Virtualization of our Financial System

Next, let me very shortly explain how currently our financial 
system deals with the buying power a.k.a money which is an asset.

## Buying Power - Money

Money is a measurement of buying power.

## Currency

Currency is a scale of buying power created by governments.

## Cash

Cash is a physical asset that helps us to prove and transfer the
underlying currency. It is printed by the government. 

## Banks

Banks are another layer of virtualization on top of the currency.
