<h1>“Being Noob” vs “Being Hacker”</h1>

<p>I was noob and will be a hacker. Right now, I am at somewhere between these two. For me the best way to achieve my goal starts with writing it’s steps down, and making it clear.

<li>MongoDb, Cassandra: Know that there are different type of database solutions for different problems, not just mysql. Read few books about them. Be able to do simple tasks on these databases. Learn which one is useful for what type of problem. If you chose to use it in your next project master it and hack it.</li>
<li>Memcache: Creating websites is not enough anymore. There are more challenges like speed, and server resources. Learn how to make things faster and cheaper.</li>
<li>Nodejs, Apache, Ngix: Now you use your own virtual or real servers, so you have to manage them. Learn all the options create your own server templates.</li>
