“Being Noob” vs “Being Hacker”
==============================

I was noob and will be a hacker. Right now, I am at somewhere between these two. For me the best way to achieve my goal starts with writing it’s steps down, and making it clear. So I wrote my own definition of both being noob and being hacker. I am sure they can not be exactly true, so share your opinions.
