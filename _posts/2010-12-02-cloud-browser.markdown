# Cloud Browser by Google

_December 2010_

Few weeks ago, I wrote a blog post which explains similarities of Chromium OS
and Rockmelt. I think Google or Facebook should fully integrate their accounts
to browser.

## Basic Idea: Problem - Solution 

Problem is the browser. Browser is a bedroom for user. It is the place you
organized, It is the place you store all your secrets. When you share your
bedroom or when you stay in friendâ€™s bedroom, neither you nor your friend
can be comfortable. For example, using some other computer even for just
few minutes is not comfortable. None of the data is mine, and my data is
not here. 

Basic solution is storing every single user data created by browser
(chrome/ie/safari or new browser) ,on the cloud. This can be done by
browser extension or by a new type of browser. User has to login to this
browser via his/her Google account, so browser can gather all the data from
web and create his/her own browser

## Passwords

User can store all of his login information in just one place, so he
does not need worry about all his passwords anymore. Just login to
the browser and it is going to remember all your logged in accounts. 

OpenID does not work well because It requires developers to learn and use
it. Instead of forcing every single website to implement an authenticatin
system, users can sync all their passwords.

This can turn google accounts in to one Unique-Online-Ids. 

## Bookmarks

Google is currently syncing all bookmarks data, but it is not enough
because I can not access them easily from a temporary device. If I can not
access them from other computer why do Google store them on cloud?

## History 

Also, the whole history of the browser has to be stored on the cloud.

## Settings - Themes - Autofill

But storing just these basic data is not enough. Every single data has to
be syned, and when user logs out, every information on local machines
should be deleted.

## Apps - Extensions - Contacts

Later on this browser can be improved by adding built-in apps, widgets and
Instant messaging application.

Please comment and tell me your opinions.
