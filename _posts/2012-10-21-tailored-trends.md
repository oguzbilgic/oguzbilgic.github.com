Twitter did what I suggested in 2010
====================================

_October 2012_

Back in 2010, [I had an idea](/Trends-I-Care.html) about being able 
to access the trends based on what matters you, which is basically
who you follow, and where you live. I am glad that Twitter finally 
changed how trending trends are aggregated.

Here is the description of the feature, written by twitter: 

> Trends tailored just for you.
>
> Trends offer a unique way to get closer to what you care about. 
> They are tailored for you based on your location and who you follow.
