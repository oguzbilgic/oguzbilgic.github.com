# Google did what I suggested in 2010

_February 2012_

Back in 2010, [I had an idea](/cloud-browser.html) about being able to access
all browser data from any machine by signing into browser. At that time Google
was already storing bookmarks on Google accounts, but It was quite different
approach.

Since that post, Google Chrome had many major releases, and now it supports not
just storing your bookmarks on Google account but [signing into
chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome/intl/en/more/sign-in.html).

> Signing in to Chrome brings your bookmarks, apps, history, and other settings
> to all your devices. Anything you update on one device instantly updates
> everywhere else, and your Chrome stuff is safe in case anything happens to your
> computer. Itâ€™s your web. Take it with you

Altough Google has done most of what I said, I dot not think we are done yet.
There is last and important step which is educating users. They should be
aware of that it is not just sync-or-not-sync but sign-in-and-sign-out.

Thanks for reading, I would love to hear your comments.
