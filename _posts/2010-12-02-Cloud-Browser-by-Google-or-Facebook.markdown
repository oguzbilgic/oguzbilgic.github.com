Cloud Browser by Google or Facebook. Not Social Browser.
========================================================

_December 2010_

Few weeks ago, I wrote a blog post about Chromium Os vs Rockmelt , “Real Google
Killer is RockMelt, Not Facebook Mail. HOW?”, which shows the similarities of
Chromium os and Rockmelt. I think one of the companies should fully integrate
it’s accounts to browser.

Basic Idea: Problem - Solution 
------------------------------

Problem is the browser. Browser is a bedroom for user. It is the place you
organized, It is the place you store all your secrets. When you share your
bedroom or when you stay in friend’s bedroom, neither you nor your friend can
be comfortable. For example, using some other computer even for just few
minutes is not comfortable. None of the data is mine, and my data is not here. 

Basic solution is storing every single user data created by browser
(chrome/ie/safari or new browser) ,on web. This can be done by browser
extension or by a new type of browser. User has to login to this browser via
his/her Google account, so browser can gather all the data from web and create
his/her own browser

ID
--

User can store all of his/her login information in just one place, so user does
not need be worry about all his/her passwords anymore. Just login to the
browser and it is gonna remember everything about you. 

OpenID does not work well because It requires developers to learn and use it.
Instead of forcing developers to use it, this system can also work with all
current login systems.

This can turn google accounts in to one Unique-Online-Ids. 

Bookmarks
---------

Google is currently syncing all bookmarks data, but it is not enough because I
can not access them from temporary computers. If I can not access them from
other computer why do Google store them on web?

Browser History 
---------------

Also, the whole history of the browser has to be stored on the web.

And All Other Preferences
-------------------------

But storing just these basic data is not enough. Every single data has to be
syned, and when user logs out, every information on local machines should be
deleted.

Apps / Widgets / Social Data / Contacts
---------------------------------------

Later on this browser can be improved by adding built-in apps, widgets and
Instant messaging application.

Please comment and tell me your opinions.
