The tiny difference between the best and the worst Apple ads
============================================================

_Dec 2012_

The image below shows the best and the worst Apple ads on the back
of the Time magazine.

What is the difference? you might ask. Let me tell you the messages 
I receive from these two ads. First one tells me that, I can consume
the same great Time magazine with much smaller form factor. On the 
other hand, the second one tells me that, I would not be able to read
the texts on the Time's cover If I were using iPad mini.
