## long answer
Hi, this is Oguz Bilgic from Turkey. I am ambitious student-entrepreneur who has interests in Computer Science and Business Administration. I created my first website when I was 12 since then I have a passion for creating high-quality, user-friendly, sexy web applications and turning them in to profitable businesses.

I believe in the art of simpilicty. I love writing beautiful and organized code. My code has to pleasure me everytime I read it. It has to be simple, efficent, organized and sexy. Sometimes I spend hours or days to just make code look better. Therefore, I love ruby and I try to use it for my projects as much as possible.  

I re-format my mac every 4 months(semester), because I hate messy things. I have a shell script that configures my mac for me. It almost removes everything and install bare minimum applications and packages. I do not like using any native application except google chrome and macvim. I pay too much attention for tiny details.

Here are the some nerd stuff I enjoy using: git, rails, ruby, vim, chrome, dropbox.

Oh! By the way, I love to meet new people and talk/discus ideas especially if you have the passions I have. I use both facebook and twitter, you can also send e-mail to obilgic at usc dot edu.
