## long answer
Hi, this is Oguz Bilgic from Turkey. I am ambitious student-entrepreneur who is majoring in Computer Science and Business Administration at USC. I created my first website when I was 12 since then I have a passion for creating high-quality, user-friendly, sexy web applications and turning them in to profitable businesses.

I believe in the art of simpilicty. I love writing beautiful and organized code. It has to be simple, efficent, organized and sexy. Sometimes I spend hours or days, just to make my code look better. Therefore, I love ruby-git and I try to use them for my projects as much as possible.  

I make a clean OS X install every 4 months(semester), because I hate messy things. I have a shell script that configures everything automatically. It almost removes everything and install bare minimum applications and packages. I do not like using any native applications except google chrome and macvim. I pay too much attention for tiny details.

Here are the some nerd stuff I enjoy using: git, rails, ruby, vim, chrome, dropbox, rdio, blackberry, lamborghini.

Oh! By the way, I love to meet new people and talk/discus ideas especially if you share the same passions I have. I use both facebook and twitter, you can also send an e-mail to obilgic at usc dot edu.
